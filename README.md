## Abstract of the research:   
  
 In the context of financial regulation and leverage control, the existence of China's high- yield bond market has become possible. This paper focuses on the premium effect of the main risk factors in the domestic high-yield market. I use two high-yield bond definition and conduct separate research. I have found that high-yield markets have significant high- yield and high-risk characteristics and are more susceptible to economic shocks. Using univariate and bivariate ranking of variate risk factors, we found that there is a significant correlation between downside risk and lagged return, while liquidity risk is significantly less predictive. In later cross-sectional regression, we control for the remaining factors of bond duration, price momentum, volatility, etc. The results show that the premium effect of the downside risk is significant at the 1% level, and the premium effect of the liquidity risk is significant at the 5% level. In the Fama-Macbeth regression, the downside risk factor remains significant, while the liquidity risk factor fluctuates significantly. More specifically, after 2016 August, the risk premium effect of the high-yield market is more significant, the high-yield bond rating is significantly negatively correlated with lagged returns, which indicating the chaos in domestic bond ratings system and the high risk aversion of investors.
